<h1>Mission 4: Look Buford, a Thermonuclear Bomb!</h1>
<p> 

    Guys, I have terrible news.
</p><p>
        Everyone from the Intergalactic Peacekeepers Society has been taken to the alien mothership! I can only imagine what horrors await them up their... may their efforts to protect us never be forgotten.

</p><p>
        Even more troublingly, my instruments are picking up the presence of several thermonuclear bombs hidden around campus! It appears that the aliens want to blow us to smithereens. I fear that if even one of these bombs is detonated, we are doomed!


</p><p>
    I am picking up the presence of six of these bombs, but my sensors are not fine-tuned enough to give you exact locations. Only the aliens know where they are. Find them and bring them back to my laboratory in the ESSC Fish Room!
</p><p>
      In terror,
      </p><p>
    Phoebe

        This mission will incorporate the following special rules:

      </p><p>
    <b>Thermonuclear Bombs</b>. These are objects clearly marked with the radiation symbol that the humans must retrieve. If you are a zombie, you <u><b>MAY NOT TAKE or TOUCH these objects</u></b>, but MAY guard them from nearby.
