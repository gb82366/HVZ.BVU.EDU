<h1>Mission 3: Who Runs from Zombies? Nerds!</h1>
      <p>
      </p><p>
              The best and brightest Beavers,
      </p><p>
              A new day dawns. With the rising sun comes the rising threat posed by the alien invaders. The members of the Intergalactic Peacekeepers Society have sprung into action. They will draw out the zombies and fight them head-on!
      </p><p> 
              I highly recommend that you take any and all precautions necessary to keep yourself and your teammates safe. The IPS crew is comprised of hardened warriors. They will be able to handle this threat, I am sure of it!
      </p><p>
              Yours truly 2019,
      </p><p>
