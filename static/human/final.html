      <h1>Final Mission: Microbial Attack!</h1>
      <p>
          My intrepid space cadets,
      </p><p>
    This is it. The moment we've all been waiting for. I have spent all day and all night in the laboratory of my grandfather (a great astronomer! Some say that he was friends with H.G. Wells!), pouring over books and looking at strange creatures floating in bottles of an unidentifiable substance, trying to come up with some plan that will rid the aliens and their horrible, zombie-followers from our planet once and for all. Finally, I believe I've cracked the case!
    These aliens do not originate from Earth. Their immune systems have not grown accustomed to the same microscopic life that we have here on Earth. I have harnessed the most deadly strains of this bacteria and boosted their microscopic abilities, channeling them into a weaponized form!
</p><p>
    I have placed a bucket full of this bacteria at Scout Park.
That is where the alien mothership has landed. Take the bacteria and attack the mothership until you can no longer do so!
    To ensure that the aliens have no way to access the spaceship and flee, once you have exhausted your supply of weaponized bacteria, you must stand guard over the remnants of the ship for 10 minutes.
</p><p>
    Now is the time to strike! They shall be slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems will be unprepared; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth. Our microscopic allies will work their overthrow.
</p><p>
    We shall see to it that no extraterrestrial would dare assume that we are mere Earthlings, incapable of defending our own world. We shall see to it that this never happens again.
</p><p>
    With starry eyes,
</p><p>
    Phoebe

    This mission will end when the clock strikes 6:00, when the Humans complete their objective, or when all of the Humans are dead.
</p><p>
    This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
</p><p>
    <b>Bacteria</b>. These are spherical projectiles full of microbial bacteria. It is to be launched at the Alien Mothership. Zombies can NOT interact with these. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU DO NOT THROW THESE AT YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS. THEIR CONTENTS WILL STAIN CLOTHING.
</p><p>
        <b>Noodle Zombie</b>. A zombie equipped with a pool noodle. This noodle counts as an extension of the zombie. As such, a human touched by a noodle is considered tagged and a noodle hit by a sock or dart stuns the zombie. The zombie may pass off the item while not stunned but CANNOT pass off the item once they are stunned.
</p><p>
        <b>Shield Zombie</b>. A zombie equipped with a small shield. The shield may block socks and darts from humans. Contact with this shield does not stun the zombie. The zombie may pass off the item while not stunned but CANNOT pass off the item once they are stunned.
</p><p>
        <b>Zombie Respawn Zones</b>. Marked by green cones, this area resets the zombieâ€™s stun timer upon entering.
