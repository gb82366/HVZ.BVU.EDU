          THIS IS PRIME MINISTER QUEEGLE SQUIGGLY OF THE ZOLFA-THURAN CAVALCADE IN SUBSECTOR ALPHA Z THETA OF THE SOLAR FEDERATION. MANY OF YOUR EARTH-SOLAR CYCLES AGO, ONE OF OUR SCOUTING SHIPS DISCOVERED YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM WHEN IT WAS THROWN FAR OFF COURSE BY A SOLAR STORM. SINCE THIS TIME, WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING YOU. OUR EYES HAVE WATCHED YOU KEENLY AND CLOSELY. AS YOU WENT ABOUT YOUR LITTLE AFFAIRS WITH INFINITE COMPLACENCY, SERENE IN YOUR ASSURANCE OF YOUR DOMINION OVER MATTER, YOU WERE BEING SCRUTINIZED, AS CLOSELY AS ONE OF YOUR EARTH-SCIENTISTS MIGHT STUDY CREATURES THAT SWARM AND MULTIPLY IN A DROP OF WATER. FEW OF YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, MINDS IMMEASURABLY SUPERIOR TO YOURS HAVE STUDIED YOUR WORLD WITH ENVIOUS EYES. YOUR BLUE OCEANS CONTAIN RICH AMOUNTS OF MINERALS WHICH WE LACK ON OUR OWN WORLD. YOUR LANDMASSES ARE BRIMMING WITH CARBON-BASED LIFEFORMS WHICH WE SEEK TO DISMANTLE AND STUDY.
      </p><p>
              SLOWLY, BUT SURELY, WE HAVE DRAWN OUR PLANS AGAINST YOU. BY THE END OF THE NEXT THREE EARTH-LUNAR CYCLES, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH A MEMBER OF YOUR HUMAN FAMILY UNIT FROM A MEMBER OF OUR SUBJUGATED TASK FORCE. THE PROCESS OF ASSIMILATING HUMANS INTO OUR RANKS HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE <u>ZOLFA-THURAN ON-SITE MILITANT-BRAINED INTERPLANETARY EXTERMINATION SQUAD</u> WILL INFILTRATE YOUR COMMUNITIES, UNDETECTABLE, BUT CARRYING A GENOME WHICH CAN BE TRANSMITTED WITH NOTHING MORE THAN PHYSICAL CONTACT.

      Welcome to Humans vs. Zombies! Grab your Nerf blaster or socks, and let the chaos begin. The original zombie has been unleashed. This zombie will appear to be a human for the first several hours of the game, but they may tag humans in the same manner as a normal zombie. Be ever vigilant! Stay on your guard! Be active!
