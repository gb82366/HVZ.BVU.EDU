    <h1>Mission 5: Operation Thunderchild</h1>
    <p>
        BV-ers, I have a plan!
    </p><p>
            Up until now, we have not been been battling the aliens, but their proxies. Their PAWNS. Those who we once could call our friends, but now are shambling husks of their former selves.

            Here is my point: has any one of us actually seen one of the aliens yet? No! That is because they are hanging out in their stupid mothership like a bunch of pansies!

            Now here is what I am thinking. So far, we have just been trying to treat the symptoms instead of fighting the disease. If we cannot battle the alien invaders on <i>Earth</i>, then we will just have to go up and meet them ourselves.
    </p><p>
            We are gonna build a spaceship.
    </p><p>
    All of the pieces of the spaceship are ready to go (as part of teambuilding for IPS, we all built a piece of the spaceship), however, they are spread far and wide across campus. Here is what I need you to do:
</p><p>
       <i>   1.</i>  Meet our world-famous engineer on the North Forum Lawn.
</p><p>
       <i>   2.</i> With her help, you will collect all 6 pieces of the spaceship and bring them back to the North Forum Lawn.
</p><p>
       <i>   3.</i>    Assemble the Spaceship in the designated area.
</p><p>
</p><p>
    <i>   4.</i>  Once the ship has been assembled, you must stand guard over it while its systems reboot.
</p><p>
    This plan is a shoe-in. There is no way it could possibly fail. We will drive back the alien invaders and save our fallen friends once and for all!

</p><p>

    The brainstorming brainiac,

            This mission will end at 7:00 or when the Humans complete their objective.
</p><p>
    This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
</p><p>
</p><p>
	  <b>Human NPC</b>. A human ally that has one bandana on both upper arms. Once these humans are tagged TWICE, they are considered "dead" and out of the mission, NOT turned into a zombie.
	</p><p>
        <b>Mission objects</b>. These are objects that one team is tasked with interacting with in some fashion. If you are on the opposing team, you MAY NOT TAKE or TOUCH these objects, but MAY guard them from nearby.
    </p><p>
            <b>Objective Zones</b>. Marked by white cones, this area denotes a mission objective and has no effect on rules.
