<h1>Mission 7: All Hail David Bowie</h1>
<p>

Rise and shine!
</p><p>

        I am nothing if I am not a student of science. I have long trusted in it, studied it, believed that it would be the savior of humanity. However, in desperate times, I must come to terms with the fact that, sometimes, my beloved discipline has its own limitations.</p><p>
        </p><p>
                Sometimes you gotta take some advice from the man livin' on Mars.
</p><p>
        Sometimes, you gotta get to church on time.
</p><p>
    Our newest ally is an expert in astroreligious theory. She has a sure-fire method of ensuring that the aliens will be unable to turn any more humans into their shambling zombie-like puppets: blessing the land itself!

    Here is her plan: she has blessings to spread throughout seven academic buildings on campus. Once all of these blessings are in place, we can call her mission a success!
</p><p>

    Meet her at the Admissions Office in DE. Her knowledge of alien religions and philosophy will surely lead us to victory!
</p><p>

    In Yoba we trust,
</p><p>
      Phoebe

This mission will end at 1:30 or when the Humans complete their objective.
</p><p>

This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
</p><p>
    <b>Human NPC.</b> A human ally that has one bandana on both upper arms. Once these humans are tagged TWICE, they are considered "dead" and out of the mission, NOT turned into a zombie.
