<h1>Mission 2: Hunt for the (R)ed (A)prils</h1>
<p>

Hey fellow Earthlings!
</p><p>
        So I am the president of a student organization called the Intergalactic Peacekeepers Society. I asked all of the members of my club to check in with me to make sure that they are still alive, but none of them have messaged me back yet.
        I worry ever so much about their safety. Please take a picture with them and bring it to me in the Underground so that I can be reassured that they are okay!!

</p><p>

    We only have 6 members, so it shouldn't take you too long. Here are their names:
</p><p>
    Dernisha Hoover, Ethan Ankrum, Gumwil Riak, Jenny Schildroth, Roy Sparks, Amanda Miley

</p><p>
      Your friend,
</p><p>
      Phoebe
</p>

</p><p>
This mission will end at 9:00 or when the Humans complete their objective.
