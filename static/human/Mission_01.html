<h1>Mission 1: Walkabout</h1>
<p>

Members of the BVU Human Resistance Team,
</p><p>

        My name is Phoebe Ogilvy. I am an Astronomy student here at BVU. I have been monitoring the oncoming alien invasion for months, but nobody heeded my warnings! They just told me that the chances of anything coming from Mars (or from anywhere in space, for that matter) is a million to one. Well, they have come!</p><p>

</p><p>

        Luckily, I have been preparing for this moment for months. I have been studying previous UFO sightings, interviewing people who claim to have made contact, keeping all of my Nerf gear in top-notch condition in the case of an invasion, stockpiling shelf stable food in the BVU Greenhouse...Not going to lie, I am excited to finally be right about something!
</p><p>
    I did not anticipate the trance-like state that they are putting our fellow students in. It seems that once they make physical contact with a human, the human becomes one of them! It is like they are, I do not know, zombie-ified!

</p><p>
        I've gotten in contact with one of the top alien-hunting squads in all of Storm Lake. They are joining us on campus! People gave them lots of good reviews on Yelp, so hopefully they can lend us a hand. Meet them at the entrance to Liberty and follow their instructions. I know that they'll for sure have a great plan to combat the invaders!
</p><p>

    Your ally,

</p><p>

This mission will end at 7:15 or when the Humans complete their objective.
</p><p>

This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
</p><p>


<b>Human NPC.</b> A human ally that has one bandana on both upper arms. Once these humans are tagged TWICE, they are considered "dead" and out of the mission, NOT turned into a zombie.
</p><p>
    <b>Harbinger.</b> It is an invulnerable, slow-moving respawn zombie. Cannot tag humans. Must maintain a reasonable distance from humans [Mod judgment call].
