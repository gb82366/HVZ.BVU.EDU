      <h1>Mission 6: Science Rules!</h1>
      <p>
          My Terrestrial Teammates,
      </p><p>
          We are working hard to study everything we can about these alien invaders! We have enlisted the help of a world-renown astrogeophysicist to study their world. Unfortunately, in the confusion of getting to campus, his assistant was lost!
          </p><p>
              You must help him retrieve his assistant so that he can continue his important scientific research! Meet him in front of the Business Office. Once you meet up with him, you must help him reach his scientific assistant at Circle Park. Once you have both of them, you must escort them safely to the Science Center so they can continue their research!
                    </p><p>
          Blasting off,
      </p><p>
