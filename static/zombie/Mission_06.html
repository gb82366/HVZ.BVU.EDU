          Z.O.M.B.I.E.S.-
      </p><p>
    YOU HUMANS ARE INCREDIBLY FOND OF PERSISTENCE WHEN IT IS CLEAR THE ONLY VIABLE OPTION IS TO SURRENDER. FORTUNATELY, THAT IS WHY IT IS EASIEST TO GET RID OF THOSE PESKY SENSES OF DUTY WITH OUR HARMLESS BRAIN ALTERATION THAT ALLOWS US TO TURN YOU INTO Z.O.M.B.I.E.S., AS YOU ALL CAN ATTEST TO. YOU DIDN'T FEEL A THING, AND, EMOTIONALLY, YOU NEVER WILL AGAIN!
</p><p>
    HA. HA. HA.
</p><p>
    AHEM. I BELIEVE THAT THE HUMANS ARE UP TO NO GOOD AGAIN. I RECOGNIZE THE FACE OF THEIR NEWEST WARRIOR. IT IS THE FACE OF A FAMOUS EARTHLING "ASTROGEOPHYSICIST" WHO HAS NEVER LEFT THE SURFACE OF YOUR TINY BLUE WORLD.
</p><p>
    DISPOSE OF HIM, AND OF HIS PESKY ASSISTANT, TOO!
</p><p>
    YOUR OVERLORD,
</p><p>
    ZOLFA-THURAN PRIME MINISTER QUEEGLE SQUIGGLY ESQ.

          This mission will end at 9:00 or when the Humans complete their objective.

          This mission will involve the following special rules:
      </p><p>
    <b>Human NPC</b>. A human ally that has one bandana on both upper arms. Once these humans are tagged TWICE, they are considered "dead" and out of the mission, NOT turned into a zombie.
