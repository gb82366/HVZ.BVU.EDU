      <h1>Mission 7: All Hail David Bowie</h1>
      <p>
          FORMER HUMANS (DUMB, INSIGNIFICANT, GREAT BULLYING PRACTICE), NOW Z.O.M.B.I.E.S.(SUPERIOR, EXCELLENT MIND-SLAVES, SUBJUGATABLE),
      </p><p>
              THIS IS HILARIOUS. OH, THIS WILL BE EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD. IF I WERE A CREATURE THAT HAD A FUNCTIONING LARYNX AS OPPOSED TO A SERIES OF INTERCONNECTED SYNAPSES THROUGH WHICH I COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF MY SPECIES, I WOULD BE ENGAGING THE LARYNXIC MUSCLES TO PRODUCE A LAUGHING SOUND.
      </p><p>
              HAHAHAHAHA
      </p><p>
    THE STILL-REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE RACE WITH WHICH YOU FORMERLY ASSOCIATED HAS ENLISTED THE HELP OF A SO-CALLED "ASTRORELIGIOUS EXPERT". WE OF THE ZOLFA-THURAN CAVALCADE EVOLVED WITHOUT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AS A BASELINE OF OUR CIVILIZATION. THEREFORE, THEIR SILLY PLAN WILL NOT BEAR FRUIT!

</p><p>
        FIND THIS SO CALLED "EXPERT" AND DISPOSE OF HER. OH, SEE IF SHE HAS ANY TEXTS ON THE SUBJECT OF ALIEN RELIGIONS ON HER PERSON, WILL YOU? I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO FIND SOMETHING NEW TO READ WHILE I REMOVE PHYSICAL WASTE FROM MY CORPORAL BODY. (I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WHAT YOU FORMER-HUMANS CALL A "JOKE".)
</p><p>
    YOUR TICKLED OVERLORD,
</p><p>
    ZOLFA-THURAN PRIME MINISTER QUEEGLE SQUIGGLY ESQ.

          This mission will end at 1:30 or when the Humans complete their objective.
      </p><p>
          This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
      </p><p>
    <b>Human NPC</b>. A human ally that has one bandana on both upper arms. Once these humans are tagged TWICE, they are considered "dead" and out of the mission, NOT turned into a zombie.
