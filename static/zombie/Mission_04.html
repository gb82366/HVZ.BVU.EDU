      <h1>Mission 4: Look Buford, A Thermonuclear Bomb!</h1>
      <p>
          MY EARTHLING UNDERLINGS,
      </p><p>
              IT PLEASES ME GREATLY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR ARMING OF THE THERMONUCLEAR BOMBS. THE HUMANS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND THEM WITH THEIR USELESS EYES AND TINY, SQUISHY BRAINS.
      </p><p>
              NOW THAT THEY ARE ARMED, <u><b>IT IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE THAT YOU DO NOT TOUCH THEM</u></b>, BUT YOU MAY STAND WATCH OVER THEM IF YOU CHOOSE. BE AWARE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS MAY ALERT THE HUMANS TO THEIR LOCATION, AND THEY MAY ATTEMPT TO DISARM THEM.
      </p><p>
              I HAVE FAITH IN THE SCIENCE THAT ALLOWED YOUR HALF-LIVING EXISTENCE TO EXIST TO ENACT THIS TASK WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE.
      </p><p>
              AS YOU HUMANS SAY, DO NOT BLOW IT.
</p><p>
        P.M. SQUIGGLY
</p><p>

    This mission will end at 3:00 or when the Humans complete their objective.
</p><p>
          This mission will involve the following special rules:
      </p><p>
              <b>Thermonuclear Bombs</b>. These are objects clearly marked with the radiation symbol that the humans must retrieve. If you are a zombie, you <u><b>MAY NOT TAKE or TOUCH these objects</u></b>, but MAY guard them from nearby.
