<h1>ZOMBIE Flash Mission 3: We've Got the Best of Both Worlds!</h1>
<p>

</p><p>
My undead friends!
</p><p>
I am intergalactically-renown volleyball player Lunar Spike! I have come to see what my home boy Squeegle has been doing on this planet. I see that the race which has evolved on this planet has come up with volleyball, the highest form of sport!
</p><p>
Meet me at the, as you call them, "volleyball courts." I want to see what you all are made of!
</p><p>
Otherworldly famous player,

L. Spike
