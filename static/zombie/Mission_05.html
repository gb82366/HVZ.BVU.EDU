    FORMER EARTHLINGS,
</p><p>
    THE HUMANS APPEAR TO BE GATHERING TOGETHER TO BUILD SOME SORT OF CONSTRUCT. ACCORDING TO OUR SENSORS, THEY ARE COLLECTING PIECES OF MACHINERY AND DELICATE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OF EFFECT THEY HONESTLY THINK THEY CAN HAVE AGAINST OUR EXTRATERRESTRIAL MIGHT, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THEY CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS FOOLISH MASQUERADE.
</p><p>
    IN NOT-SO-MANY-WORDS: PUT A STOP TO THIS NONSENSE.
</p><p>
    THE RIGHTFUL RULER OF THIS PUNY PLANET,
</p><p>
    P.M. SQUIGGLY

          This mission will end at 7:00 or when the Humans complete their objective.
      </p><p>
        This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
	   </p><p>
	   </p><p>
	   	  <b>Human NPC</b>. A human ally that has one bandana on both upper arms. Once these humans are tagged TWICE, they are considered "dead" and out of the mission, NOT turned into a zombie.
	</p><p>
	           <b>Mission objects</b>. These are objects that one team is tasked with interacting with in some fashion. If you are on the opposing team, you MAY NOT TAKE or TOUCH these objects, but MAY guard them from nearby.
	       </p><p>
	               <b>Objective Zones</b>. Marked by white cones, this area denotes a mission objective and has no effect on rules.
	       </p><p>
