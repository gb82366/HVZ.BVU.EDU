      <h1>Mission 2: Hunt for the (R)ed (A)prils</h1>
      <p>
      MY ARMY OF Z.O.M.B.I.E.S.,
      </p><p>
    IT APPEARS THAT THE PUNY EARTHLINGS ARE MORE INCLINED TO RESISTANCE THAN OTHER EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPECIES THAT WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED AND SUBSEQUENTLY SUBJUGATED. INTERESTING.
</p><p>
    WELL, AS YOU HUMANS SAY, TWO STONES CAN BE THROWN AT THAT GAME.
</p><p>
              EARTH'S NEW SUPREME RULER,
      </p><p>
              PRIME MINISTER QUEEGLE SQUIGGLY ESQ.
      </p><p>
              P.S. I DO BELIEVE THAT I AM GETTING THE HANG OF THESE HUMAN IDIOMS. THEY REALLY DO, AS YOU SAY, SHOOT AN ARROW INTO MY FUNNY BONE.

          This mission will end at 9:00 or when the Humans complete their objective.
