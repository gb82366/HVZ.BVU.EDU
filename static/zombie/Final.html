      <p>
          HIGHLY VALUED Z.O.M.B.I.E.S,
      </p><p>

    WE ARE EVER SO CLOSE TO TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION. OUR MIGHT HAS GROWN EVEN STRONGER THANKS TO YOUR HELP, AND IT HAS NOW BECOME TOO POWERFUL FOR THE HUMANS TO FIGHT OFF FOR ANY LONGER.
</p><p>
    WE HAVE LANDED OUR MOTHERSHIP ON THE GROUNDS OF SCOUT PARK. WE WILL SEND OUT AN ELECTROMAGNETIC SIGNAL INTO THE WEAK BRAINS OF ALL HUMANS ON THE PLANET. YOU MUST KILL ALL OF THE HUMANS ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY OUR SHIP. THROUGH THIS, WE WILL TRANSFORM ALL OF HUMANITY INTO MEMBERS OF THE Z.O.M.B.I.E.S. WITH NO MORE NEED FOR PHYSICAL CONTACT. IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN AND THE HUMANS DO NOT DESTROY OUR SHIP, WE SHALL TURN ALL PATHETIC EARTH-HUMANS INTO ZOMBIES IN ONE FELL SWOOP.
</p><p>
WE WILL BRING YOU SPECIAL BOONS IN ORDER TO BETTER DESTROY HUMANS.
</p><p>
    IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE SUBJUGATING YOU ALL. SOON, THE EARTH WILL BELONG TO US.
</p><p>
    YOUR OVERLORD,

    This mission will end when the clock strikes 6:30, when the Humans complete their objective, or when all of the Humans are dead.
</p><p>
    This mission will incorporate the following special rules:
</p><p>
    <b>Bacteria</b>. These are spherical projectiles full of microbial bacteria. It is to be launched at the Alien Mothership. Zombies can NOT interact with these. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU DO NOT THROW THESE AT YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS. THEIR CONTENTS WILL STAIN CLOTHING.â€¯
</p><p>
        <b>Noodle Zombie</b>. A zombie equipped with a pool noodle. This noodle counts as an extension of the zombie. As such, a human touched by a noodle is considered tagged and a noodle hit by a sock or dart stuns the zombie. The zombie may pass off the item while not stunned but CANNOT pass off the item once they are stunned.
</p><p>
        <b>Shield Zombie</b>. A zombie equipped with a small shield. The shield may block socks and darts from humans. Contact with this shield does not stun the zombie. The zombie may pass off the item while not stunned but CANNOT pass off the item once they are stunned.
</p><p>
        <b>Zombie Respawn Zones</b>. Marked by green cones, this area resets the zombie's stun timer upon entering. This mission's respawn zone is located in front of <u>Smith</u>.
